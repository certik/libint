07/11/2006:     Can choose cartesian shell orderings using configure option
                --with-cgshell-ordering.
                -EFV

07/11/2006:     All API names can now be prefixed with the string specified with --with-api-prefix
                configure option.
                -EFV

07/05/2006:     Created a standard set of tests for most combinations of code generation
                features (vectorization, etc.)
                -EFV

07/04/2006:     1) Added --with-api-prefix and --enable-accum-ints configure options (the latter
                   doesn't work yet).
                2) libint2_init_XXX, libint2_need_memory_XXX, and libint2_cleanup_XXX functions
                   manage allocation of stack. libint2_init_XXX takes an optional external buffer
                   as an argument.
                3) libint2_cleanup.cc is not longer produced -- its contents are in libint2_init.cc
                -EFV

03/01/2006:     1) test_eri.pl can generate code with or without CSE
                2) correct FLOP counts are produced even for the condensed code
                -EFV

02/28/2006:     Added ability to condense multiple statements into one, provided
                that no reusable quantities appear. The current version generates
                correct code, but FLOP counts are not correct
                and the degree of "condensation" is not adjustable yet.
                This development is important
                for generating efficient linewise vectorized code.
                -EFV

02/18-26/2006:  1) with-vector-method configure option specifies how to vectorize.
                2) linewise-vectorized set-level RR codes were not correct. Such
                   functions now use special stack to keep intermediates.
                -EFV

02/18/2006:     1) eri-opt-am and g12-opt-am are properly taken into account.
                   introduced GraphRegistry to do that.
                2) vector length can be set via configure script.
                -EFV

02/16/2006:	Library can now be exported. Do 'make export'. This creates a .tgz
                file in the top object directory. -EFV

02/15/2006:     1) Added --enable-flop-counter configure option
                2) --with-float-type option now has the advertised effect
                3) Added --with-eri-strategy configure option
                4) Added API elements to configure Libint2-MPQC interface
                -EFV

02/14/2006:     1) GenIntegralSet computes size directly instead of using SubIterator.
                   This reduces dramatically the memory requirements.
                2) Remove RR from RRStack when generating code. This frees up a ton
                   of memory too.
                Now ERI code can be generated for up to i-functions in a few
                hundred megs of RAM.
                -EFV

02/14/2006:     Revamped configure.in for version 2 production. Minor fixes
                all over the place. Updated installation manual. -EFV

02/14/2006:     Removed libderiv and libr12 sources. -EFV

11/30/2005:	Added installation manual. -EFV

11/29/2005:	Class documentation is installed correctly now. -EFV

11/28/2005:	Test if cxx and cxxgen allow templates with default parameters to match template
		template parameters with fewer arguments. libint2::Policy requires
		such an extension (e.g. gcc-3.4). -EFV

11/28/2005:	Added cxxgen options to configure. Timing code is now compiled
                using cxxgen. -EFV

11/27-28/2005:	Updated configure.in for autoconf 2.57. -EFV

11/27/2005:	Upgraded to libtool-1.5.20. -EFV

11/27/2005:	Started updates-libint2 file. -EFV
