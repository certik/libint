An excellent paper in which the idea of $linear$ $r_{12}$-methods was
formulated (to my knowledge) for the first time.
Several $r_{12}$-dependent ansatzes were proposed. 
It is shown that for single-reference problems only the reference wavefunction
have to be multiplied by the $g_{12}$-factor to achive VERY fast
convergence. Two cases were examined : MP2 and full CI on the ground
state of He. CI procedure converged much faster than MP2. 
Applicability to larger systems (with more than 2 electrons) is
discussed. The ways to avoid ``difficult'' integrals are outlined.
